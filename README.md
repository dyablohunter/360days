## Why Choose the 360 Days Calendar?

### Unmatched Precision
By setting each second to 1014.56 milliseconds, the 360 Days Calendar ensures that a 360-day year aligns perfectly with the Earth's orbit around the Sun (the tropical year). No more leap days or manual corrections—just pure, consistent accuracy.

### Perfect Consistency
With 12 months of 30 days each, every year follows the same predictable pattern. No more dealing with short Februarys or leap-year surprises. This uniformity simplifies everything from budgeting to event planning.

### Future-Proof Design
Built to last, the 360 Days Calendar requires no adjustments for centuries. It’s a timekeeping solution that’s as reliable today as it will be for generations to come.

### Easy Integration
Our open-source API lets you seamlessly convert dates between the Gregorian and 360 Days calendars. Whether you’re coding a scheduling app or exploring timekeeping innovation, we’ve got you covered.

How It Works
The 360 Days Calendar redefines the second to 1014.56 milliseconds, allowing a year of exactly 360 days to align with the tropical year (the time it takes Earth to orbit the Sun). This eliminates the need for leap days or other corrections found in traditional calendars.
Calendar Structure
Year: 360 days

Months: 12 months, each with 30 days

Days: 24 hours

Hours: 60 minutes

Minutes: 60 seconds

Seconds: 1014.56 milliseconds

This elegant structure ensures consistency and precision, making timekeeping intuitive and reliable.
Benefits
No Leap Years: A future-proof system with no adjustments needed.

Consistent Months: Every month is 30 days, simplifying planning.

Precision: Perfectly aligned with the tropical year.

Ease of Use: Uniform design benefits users and developers alike.
