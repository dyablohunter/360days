# 360 Days Calendar

Welcome to the **360 Days Calendar** project! This innovative timekeeping system reimagines how we track the passage of time. Instead of the traditional Gregorian calendar, this system divides the year into **12 months of 30 days each**, totaling 360 days. To stay perfectly aligned with the tropical year (approximately 365.2422 days), we’ve adjusted the length of a second to **1014.56 milliseconds** (instead of the standard 1000 milliseconds). This eliminates the need for leap years or other periodic corrections, delivering a **precise, consistent, and elegant calendar**.

Whether you're a developer looking to integrate this into your app, a timekeeping enthusiast, or just curious about alternative calendars, this project has something for you!
